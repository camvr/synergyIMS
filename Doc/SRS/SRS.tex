This document describes the requirements for the \textit{Synergy Inventory Management System}.
\noindent
The template for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\noindent
We want to give a simple and quick-start inventory management system to small businesses and warehouses who do not have the resources or funding to set up an expensive enterprise management system.

\subsection{The Stakeholders} % taken from problem statement
\noindent
The stakeholders this application targets are small businesses with a smaller inventory size without the financial ability to use an inventory management system meant for large companies. These would usually be businesses where the owner themselves would track inventory, thus not being a complete expert in the nuances of inventory tracking.

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for this product is also an outside reviewer. The client wishes to see a product that demonstrates the concepts of a software engineering project consisting of proper documentation and a final demonstration of the product.
\subsubsection{The Customers}
\noindent
The intended customers are small businesses and warehouses who do not have the resources, funding or need for large scale enterprise inventory management solutions. % maybe expand on this? i think this may be good though

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
% Testers, Business analysts, tech experts, system designers, domain experts, usability experts... I think thats us?
The stakeholders involved in this product are the teaching assistants whose knowledge will be needed to properly document the product. These stakeholders will have a large influence over the direction of the project and the time constraints of the deliverables for the product.
\subsection{Mandated Constraints} % double check these in regards to our requirements -- consider constraints to be non-negotiable terms, where any other solution would be unacceptable.
\noindent
Description: The product shall be hosted and maintained on a public IP address to allow remote access to the platform.\\
Rationale: The customers will not have the resources or infrastructure to install, host and maintain the platform themselves.\\
Fit criterion: The site and database must be hosted remotely and always accessible by the customer.\\

% this one is sketchy...
\noindent
Description: The product shall be made using NodeJS and store data on a PostgreSQL database.\\
Rationale: The technologies used must have extensive support and must be a modern "Industry Standard".\\
Fit criterion: The product shall pass testing for the technologies and must connect to a PostgreSQL server.\\

% should be able to pull more constraints from the requirements shell
\noindent
Description: The product shall be interfaced with using HTML, CSS, and Javascript through a web browser.\\
Rationale: HTML, CSS, and javascript are the industry standard for accessing web pages and are platform independent.\\
Fit criterion: The product shall maintain standards according to the world wide web consortium.\\


\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\noindent
SIMS: Synergy Inventory Management System. The name of the product abbreviated for ease of communication.\\
Node: NodeJS. The technology being used in the development of the product. "Node" is not used to refer to a singularity, point or vertex.\\
CSV: Comma Separated Values. CSV refers to the file type, commonly available on most systems.\\
Properly Formatted: Format matching developer's specification.\\
HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language\\
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets\\

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
% User characteristics should go under assumptions.
\subsubsection*{Facts}
% put facts here
% i.e. The existing enterprise software costs a lot of money
The existing application consists of 3000 lines of PHP code.\\
20 percent of all inventory items represent 80 percent of inventory costs.\\


\subsubsection*{Assumptions}
% read the volere template examples for what types of things should go here
The server hosting the web service shall be maintained by a third party web server hosting company. \\
\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
%clearly define boundaries for study of the work and requirements%
Specific tasks can be found in the Gantt chart.
Usable resources include access to a server to host the website and any open source code.

This demonstration includes a low-level working prototype including the primary features present in the final design including user log-in and account creation, storing and retrieving user inventory information.\\
The prototype must be responsive when requests are made to access and store information.\\

\noindent Revision 0 Demonstration\\
Required operational date: 11/15/17\\
This demonstration will include the fully tested, finished application revised with feedback from the proof of concept demo with all working events. This application should be accessible online. \\

\noindent Final Demonstration\\
Required operational date: 11/29/17\\
A working copy of the product shall be demonstrated to the client and stakeholders.\\

\noindent Revision 1\\
Required operational date: 12/5/17\\
The final revision and changes of the documentation and project shall be uploaded to the GitLab repository.\\
